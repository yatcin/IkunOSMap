# IkunOSTile
![IkunOSTile ScreenShot](https://github.com/yatcin/IkunOSMap/blob/master/ikunostile.png "IkunOSTile ScreenShot")<br>
We launched “**IkunOSTile**” [Ikunòstáil] : a tile layer for foreigners.<br>
Some objects on the OpenStreetMap, are registered with a tag “**name:en**” (English name),  this layer describes these objects with that English name for labeling.<br>
(except some objects have no “name:en” tag)

# Why IkunOSTile?
“**Ikuno Ward**” (or “**Ikuno-Ku**”) is one of 24 wards of Osaka, Japan. And as known the most largest foreigner registrations stay in the city, so we named “IkunOSTile” by
(more information for Ikuno Ward, see at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikuno-ku,_Osaka)
